# Battleship
The idea is simple: try to guess the location of the computer's ships in as few tries as possible!

Depending on how many ships you choose to start, there will be 3, 4, or 5 on a 7x7, 8x8, or 9x9 grid.

You can guess blocks with a letter followed by a number in the range of A to I and 1 to 9. (B4, G7, etc.)
